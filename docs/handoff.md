# Current Handoff

## Phase

Domain core complete (Phases 1–4 of the implementation plan: model, graph, scheduling, decision engine)

## Current Task

TASK-007 — Implement scenario simulation

## State

TASK-006 is complete and awaiting review/merge on branch feat/006-recommendation-explainability. The recommendation layer (`recommendNextTask`) wraps the deterministic engine with a full explanation structure: machine-readable factor ids, a fixed-order assumption list, condition-triggered warnings with stable ids and emission order (ADR-008), and an explainable empty state when nothing is eligible. The next task is scenario simulation.

## Completed

- PROJECT_PLAN.md
- AGENTS.md
- opencode.json (default_agent: builder)
- agent definitions (builder, tester, reviewer, orchestrator)
- architecture document
- decision record (ADR-001 through ADR-008)
- task backlog
- progress log
- handoff document
- Git repository initialized with initial commit
- TypeScript project initialized (npm, strict mode)
- Vitest test runner configured
- ESLint + Prettier configured
- Verification commands working (typecheck, test, lint, format)
- Domain model entities: Project, Task, Goal
- TaskStatus enum (BACKLOG, TODO, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE)
- Factory functions with invariant validation
- Domain invariant tests (23 domain tests + 1 smoke test = 24 total passing)
- Dependency graph: prerequisite/dependent lookup, traversal, reachability, cycle detection, deterministic topological ordering
- Graph tests (34 tests = 58 total passing)
- Scheduling: forward/backward pass CPM, critical path identification, slack calculation
- Scheduling tests (13 tests = 71 total passing)
- Decision engine: eligibility rules, composable additive scoring (six default factors), deterministic lexicographic tie-breaking, structured factor breakdowns, frozen results
- Decision engine tests (31 tests = 102 total passing across 8 files)
- ADR-007 documenting eligibility, scoring model, normalization, tie-breaking, and selection policy; ADR-004 marked Accepted
- Recommendation explainability: `recommendNextTask` with machine-readable factor ids, fixed-order assumptions, ordered conditional warnings, explainable empty state, frozen deterministic output
- Engine additions: stable factor ids on `EvaluationFactor`, normalization `maxValues` exposed on `EvaluationResult`
- Review follow-up: deep freezing applied to all result objects (evaluations, factors, assumptions, warnings), `TaskEvaluation`-typed warning inputs, readable multi-metric warning formatting, additional edge-case tests
- Recommendation tests (24 tests + 1 new engine test = 129 total passing across 9 files)
- ADR-008 documenting the explainability representation

## Not Yet Started

- scenario simulation
- persistence
- application services
- UI

## Human Decisions Still Needed

These are intentionally provisional:

1. Final product name and availability.
2. Exact decision-engine weights.
3. Exact scheduling/calendar semantics.
4. Final UI technology selection.
5. Final MVP scenario scope.
6. Benchmark methodology.

## Next Recommended Action

Implement TASK-007 — Implement scenario simulation.

## Verification

TASK-006 verification is complete. All commands pass: `npm run verify` (typecheck, 129 tests, lint, format).

## Important Constraint

Domain code must not depend on React, Next.js, browser APIs, or persistence.
